Encounter Audit Module
=========

### About

Encounter Audit Module is an open source module for OpenMRS that is meant to assess the quality of encounters entered into OpenMRS. The module relies on having a copy of the encounter that can be re-entered into the EMR. The module will then store the original record and the new audit record for comparison. This comparison is then used to determine the data quality of various encounters in OpenMRS. 

### Module Status

This module is still be developed for release, but here is a summary of the current status. 

#### Completed:

* Ability to sample encounters by parameters including creator, date range, encounter type, and location
* Functionality to specify the number of encounters to audit
* Saving projects by project name, description, and recording project parameters
* Organization of audit encounters into a sortable table
* Selecting an audit record brings up an htmlform specific to the type of encounter
* Ability to re-enter the encounter (based off original paper record)
* Built in comparison of existing encounter and the audit encounter
	* Differences highlighted and brought to the user's attention
	* User can view differences and either cancel the audit, update the audit or submit the audit

#### Future: 

* Capability to save and recall previously sampled encounters (from saved project information)
* Capability to store the original encounter observations and the audited encounter observations
* Ability to correct original observations/encounters based on audit information
* Capability to classify differences (e.g. missing, value mismatch, not on paper, etc.)
* Classifying and flagging audit project and encounter statuses
	* Ability to automatically sample based on project type (e.g. to select an appropriate random population for a given confidence interval or to produce a lot quality assurance assessment)
* Capability to add/delete encounters from projects
* Ability to generate projects based on project type
* Basic reporting capabilities
	* Quality of data by user
	* Types of errors (e.g. user left record blank, user filled in data missing from paper record, user entered in a value with insufficient precision, paper record was difficult to read or changed, impossible to represent accurately in EMR, etc.)
	* Quality of data based on location
	* Quality of data for a user defined project, program, or encounter type
	* Quality of data based on observation
	* Statistical calculations for confidence intervals, sensitivity, LQAS, etc.
